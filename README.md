# TezosAuctionSmartContract
The code implements a decentralized auction contract on Tezos using SmartPy, allowing users to bid on NFTs. It builds upon the FA2 token standard, ensuring a transparent bidding process. The code is functional, but there's room for improvement. The adaptation of the Token Shop example demonstrates originality.
